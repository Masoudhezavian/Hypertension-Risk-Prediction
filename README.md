# Hypertension-Risk-Prediction
This dataset is related to predicting the risk of high blood pressure. First, the numerical and categorical columns were identified, and then the number of null values was examined. The dataset is approximately balanced, and frequency plots for the categorical columns were generated. Next, outlier values were handled, and modeling was performed using three models: Random Forest, CatBoost, and XGBoost. All three models achieved high accuracy, and a metrics table for these models was prepared. However, the CatBoost model showed slightly higher accuracy compared to the other two models.
